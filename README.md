# pitrilib (old)
A deprecated relic of the past. This was supposed to be my main C++ library, but I wasn't very happy with it. I guess, I was a bit too ambitious and worked at too many places simultaneously, which made me lose focus and overview of the whole thing. I'm not even sure the project compiles successfully in this state.

Due to a limitation of the used image library () it's Windows only as well. And looking over it, my coding style has changed quite a lot.

I would have already deleted it, but a friend told me I should leave it here, as "proof of work" for potential future employers.

So, if you're looking over my code right now, hi! It's old and dusty (wow, no kidding. Last commit in 2017, that was even before I went to college to study applied informatics), but if anything, it primarily proves how long I've worked with C++, I guess.
